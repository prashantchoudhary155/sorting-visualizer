# Sorting Visualizer

We are all aware of many sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, and so on, but we frequently fail to comprehend the algorithms due to a lack of visual information. This React Web-App will assist you in visualising these algorithms for better understanding. We started this project because we were always fascinated that the concept of organization could be so easily captured within algorithms, as well as the fact that some core mathematical principles can make some incredibly-fast algorithms.

Check out our App at [Sorting Visualizer](https://effortless-llama-edff71.netlify.app/)

## Demo

![](https://github.com/MANAN14/Sorting-Visualizer/blob/main/sortingVisualiser.gif)

## Features

- Vary the pace and length of array
- Able to randomize arrays 
- Select several sorting algorithms to visualise with their time and space complexity. 
- Link to an article on these sorting methods so that you can easily learn and see them at the same time.

## Future Scope of Improvement

- Make it responsive
- Add more sorting algorithms to our project
- Run all the algorithms together for the same array to actually understand the time complexity.
- Vary speed when sorting is in process

## Tech Stack

React,  HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How to run?

Clone this repository into your system. 

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
